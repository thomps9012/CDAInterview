# CDAInterview

Attached is a custom duplicate build out of the CDA Interview Application website

Only the home page and contact us pages are functioning, though the navbar and javascript could be built out to further enhance the functionality of the website

Images and text are easily changed out through either using the CSS styling sheet or the href links in the HTML sheets

There are also the requested facebook and google pixel links in the header of each HTML element

The website is live through a github pages server at : https://thomps9012.github.io/CDAInterview/

The website is also mobile responsive.

Lastly the website itself is password protected (password is = pepper) through a simple javascript function this wouldn't be the best future practice. To achieve better password protection would be to us server side (i.e. PHP) so the password isn't visible to anyone who inspects the front end.
