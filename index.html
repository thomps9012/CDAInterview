        <h3 id=purpose>What is the purpose of the dental school interview?</h3>
        <p>Regardless of the format of dental school interview (e.g. CDA structured interview, MMI, or Panel interview),
            the purpose of the interview is rather straightforward and remains constant across the board: to assess the
            personality and Non-Cognitive Skills (NCSs) of the candidate.

            What are NCSs? By these we mean the following: Communication skills, interpersonal skills, ethical and moral
            decision making capacity, maturity, professionalism, sense of social responsibility, service to community,
            leadership, initiative, scholarship, ability to collaborate with others, conflict resolution skills, etc.

            Research has shown that, although academic performance (i.e. GPA and DAT scores) is a great indicator of
            didactic abilities in the first and second years of dental school, it provides, however, a very poor
            predictive value when it comes to future clinical performance. In fact, research shows that, an effective
            interview process is the best indicator of future clinical performance in the upper years, as it gives
            insight into the characteristics of the candidate and whether or not there will be a likelihood of future
            behavioural problems (an issue that dental schools constantly encounter and struggle to overcome). For
            example, it has been shown that those candidates who are "conscientious" and "open to new experiences"
            perform more effectively in the third and fourth years of dental school studies, where the education takes
            place in a clinical setting for the most part.

            Thus, dental schools, much like other professional schools, have over the past decade spent a lot of
            resources to devise the most effective interview process that will give them insight into the NCSs of their
            future candidates. And of course, for Canadian dental schools the answer has been the Canadian Dental
            Association's structured interview or CDA structured interviews.

        </p>
        <h3 id=history>History, rationale, and the structure of the CDA interview</h3>
        <p>Recall from our discussion above that we said an effective interview process is the most reliable way to
            select candidates who perform well clinically. Well in an attempt to test this theory, in 2004, Smithers et
            al. conducted a study, which produced results that were so shocking, that it unequivocally reinforced the
            Canadian Dental Association's earlier decision to commission a "new structured interview based on
            state-of-the-art contemporary interview techniques" (i.e. CDA structured interview)

            What were these shocking results you may ask? The evidence gathered by Smithers et al. (2004) simply
            reinforced earlier suspicions about the ineffectiveness of traditional interview processes. They showed
            that, "a typical [traditional] admissions interview was in fact worse than neutral in that it was negatively
            associated with students' performance in the first year of dental training, did not predict academic
            performance, and may have led to poor selection decisions." Thus, it should come as no surprise that the
            traditional panel interview has been replaced by most dental school with the CDA structured interview, which
            is a more reliable and valid future predictor of clinical performance.

            The CDA interview was not only re-structured in its format of delivery, but it was also restructured in
            terms of the type of questions that would be ask, and how they would be rated or scored by the interviewers.
            Let us first talk about the type of questions that you may encounter on your CDA structured interview.

        </p>
        <h3 id=questions>Types of Questions</h3>
        <p>
            The types of questions that you may be asked during your dental school interview can be divided into two
            categories: (1) Situational Interview (SI) questions and (2) Patterned Behaviour Descriptive Interview
            (PBDI) questions. SI questions are those in which the candidates is placed in a hypothetical situations
            (i.e. vignette) and is asked what they would react in that given situation. For example,

            "You are babysitting your sisterâ€™s young child, who is nervous and upset about his mother being away. You
            are trying to calm him down and offer him some ice cream. As you are dishing out the ice cream, the child
            bites down hard on your hand. How would you react?"

            Conversely, PBDI type questions, ask the candidates "about past behaviour with the assumption that past
            behaviour is the best predictor of future behaviour." An example of a PBDI type questions is:


            Many of us have had to deal with juggling busy schedules. Think of a time in the past when an important but
            unscheduled situation arose that required your attention, but you had a number of prior commitments on your
            agenda. What did you do? What was the outcome?

            Notice how SI questions are typically future-oriented, as opposed to PBDI questions, which are
            past-oriented. The specific and actual SI and PBDI questions are devised according to seven competencies,
            that the CDA has found to be reliable and valid indicators of future performance. In other words, every
            question that is asked during a dental school interview, regardless of being a SI or PBDI question, will
            address one or more than one of the seven competencies.
        </p>
        <h3 id=seven>The Seven Competencies</h3>
        <p>1. Communication: does the applicant have excellent communication skills?
            <br>
            2. Conscientiousness: is the applicant thorough, careful to do tasks well?
            <br>
            3. Integrity : is the applicant honest with themselves and others?
            <br>
            4. Judgment and analysis: does the applicant have the capability to make sound judgments? Do they gather all
            the facts before making a decision?
            <br>
            5. Self-control : Does the applicant remain calm and in control in difficult situations?
            <br>
            6. Sensitivity to others : Does the applicant show empathy towards others? Do they take the feelings of
            others into consideration?
            <br>
            7. Tact and diplomacy : Does the applicant show sensitivity in dealing with difficult issues? Does the
            applicant possess the necessary skills to deal with others without causing negative feelings?
            <br>
            Notice in the above examples that the SI sample question is addressing the competencies of self-control,
            sensitivity to others, communication, while the PBDI question addresses the competencies of
            conscientiousness, Integrity, and judgement and analysis. In all of the questions that will be asked of you
            during your interview, the competency of communication is a constant that is continuously tested and
            retested. In order to be successful, however, you will have to be able to know which other competencies also
            apply to the question so that you can formulate an appropriate response, which touches on the key factors
            essential for the interviewers.</p>
        <h3 id=structure>Structure of the CDA Interview</h3>
        <p>The CDA structured interview is comprised of seven questions, one for each of the seven competencies
            described above. Each question, which can either be a SI or a PBDI type, is scored on a 5-point scale for a
            total and a maximum of 35 points by two interviewers who are either a pair of dentists, or senior dental
            students. The interview usually takes about 20-30 minutes to be completed.
